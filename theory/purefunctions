# Pure Functions

Funtional Programming is operating exclusively with pure Functions
on immutable values.

There are two rules for a pure function:

1. It has no side effects

Examples for side effects are:
- Every form of IO
- Mutating state outside the scope of the function itself
- throwing Exceptions

2. It returns always the same value for the same input.

Those pure functions called have an interesting characteristic called
referential transparency.
It states that you can always replace the result of a function called
with actually calling the function.
