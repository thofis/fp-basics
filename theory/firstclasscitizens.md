# Functions as first class citizens

A requirement for any programming language to support the functional paradigm is to support functions as first class citizens. This means that a function can be treated like any other value, eg. assigned to a variable, used as an argument or a return value of another function.
Such programming languages usually have a shorthand syntax for specifying anonymous function expressions (lambdas).
